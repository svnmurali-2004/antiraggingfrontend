      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Introduction:</strong> Ragging is strictly prohibited in this institution. We believe in fostering a positive
        and respectful environment for all students. Ragging in any form is a violation of the dignity and well-being of
        individuals and goes against the principles of mutual respect and understanding that we uphold.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Definition:</strong> Ragging includes any conduct by any student or students whether by words spoken or
        written or by an act that has the effect of teasing, treating or handling with rudeness a fresher or any other student.
        Indulging in rowdy or undisciplined activities that cause or are likely to cause annoyance, hardship, physical or
        psychological harm or to raise fear or apprehension thereof in a fresher or a junior student or asking the students to
        do any act or perform something which such student will not do in the ordinary course and which has the effect of
        causing or generating a sense of shame or embarrassment so as to adversely affect the physique or psyche of a fresher
        or a junior student.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">

      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Consequences of Ragging:</strong> Any student found guilty of ragging or abetting ragging, whether actively
        or passively, or being a part of a conspiracy to promote ragging, shall be severely punished. The punishment may
        include expulsion, suspension, or any other action as decided by the institution authorities.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Reporting of Ragging:</strong> Students are encouraged to report any incidents of ragging to the Anti-Ragging
        Committee or the authorities. Confidentiality of the identity of the complainant shall be maintained.
